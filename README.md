### Hi there 👋

My name is Armando Vilaça Lambertucci from Brazil. I am a Full-Stack Developer, my preview background was as a Civil Engineer with Geotechnical Degree. 
End of 2018 I made a difficult decision of changing profession, truth is that I always looked at I.T in my graduation as something really challenging and pleasant at the same time therefore I decided to give a chance to my tech-side and started a WebDevelopment degree, I was blown away by how rewarding was to create things and solve problems .then("Ok I really like it, and in that I will put all my effort" :rocket:).catch("resilience!" :muscle:)

Started in 2019 working as a Full-Stack Developer in Tecna Sistemas (https://www.tecnasistemas.com.br/). I've beeing building integrations and private apps between Zendesk and other plataforms like (ERP, TSM etc...) I'm really gratefull to Tecna Sistemas that bet on me and opened the doors so I could deliver the best of me.

Recently I joined Code7 (https://www.code7.com/) Python Back-end team, I integrate Code7 cloud products with CRM, CSM as, Salesforce, Hubspot, Zendesk, Pipedrive, RD etc... We are Sass and AWS partners, thats why we use a lot of AWS services such as Lambdas, SNS, CloudFront, CloudWatch, DynamoDB et...

In my free time I like to play (and watch) tenis (🎾), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to play the guitar (🎸) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
